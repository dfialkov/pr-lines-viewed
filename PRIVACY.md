# Privacy Policy — GitHub Lines Viewed

**Last updated:** 2026-02-12

GitHub Lines Viewed is a browser extension that displays how many changed lines you have viewed in a GitHub pull request.

## Data collection

This extension does **not** collect, transmit, or store any personal data. It does not communicate with any external servers.

## Local storage

The extension uses `chrome.storage.sync` solely to persist your display preference (split vs. unified color mode). This setting is synced across your Chrome profiles by Chrome itself and is never sent to the extension developer or any third party.

## Permissions

- **storage** — Used to save your display preference.
- **Host permission (github.com)** — Required to read pull request metadata on GitHub pages and inject the lines-viewed indicator.

## Contact
